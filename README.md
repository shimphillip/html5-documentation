# HTML5 Documentation

Good looking documentation page for HTML5.

## Screenshots

## User stories

1. User can navigate to any html tags through navbar.
2. The navbar shows currently selected page.
3. Code highlighting.
4. Responsive.

## Tech stack

- React
- Next.js
- React hooks
- react-responsive

## Lessons I learned

- Because it's server rendered, initial pageload is faster but navigating to different pages surely does take longer because of network requests.
- Next.js supports static site building now. As long as components don't fetch initial props through api requests, nextjs intelligently converts the app into static site when building and bundling the app ðŸ’ª
- Next.js supports same file stlye changes with <style jsx> tags, very convenient.
- Good SEO

## Credits

- W3Schools for documentation texts.
- Amazing official docs by Zeit team.
- react-highlight (kind of wish they had smaller bundle sizes though)
- zeit now for CD
